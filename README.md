# Dynamic dependency injection

This is a small PHP code that demonstrates injecting a dependency that is not known until runtime.

Reading the comments in the code will hopefully explain the idea clearly.

To try it / play with it:

`$ git clone https://github.com/pwm/dynamic-dependency-injection.git`

`$ composer install`

`$ app/console feed-reader json "http://foobar.com/feed"`
 
Open for any suggestions/improvements.
